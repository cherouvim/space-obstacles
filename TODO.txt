TODO
- preload collision sound
- press start to start so sounds can be heard
- constant collision should not be possible. use timeout to reset collision.
- enemies entering scene from outside
- levels or linear difficulty increase
- empty canvas black palette animation
- encode inertia into player data
- encode trembling into player data
- implement player trembling
- obstacle sounds (when entering screen?)
- high score (local storage)
- space like player rotation while moving
- full refresh on redeployment (github pages varnish? assets cache killer?)
- resizing canvas needs to recalculate sizex, sizey, and radiusPixels of all elements

MAYBE
- improve favicon?
- conditional rounding (rounding vs no rounding [subpixel rendering]) based on performance
- use cloudflare
- webp

NO/IGNORE
- github link
