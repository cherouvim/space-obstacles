TODOs
- mouse/touch handler - decide whether to center player on touch end
- mouse/touch handler - player initially jumps on 0,0
- background animation improvement (constant move and %)
- DO NOT reload images and recalculate sizey on background images
- scores/health UI
- enemies
- levels

IMPROVE
- favicon
- conditional rounding (rounding vs no rounding [subpixel rendering]) based on performance

MAYBE/FUTURE
- use cloudflare
- webp
- lock orientation on PWA?
- refresh canvas on rotate?

NO/IGNORE
- github link

DONE
- splash screen
- calculate game screen (max X, Y -> resize/scale canvas on more than that, or simply center a bounded box).
- loader UI
- manifest.json metadata
- SEO metatags
- evaluate a sound engine (volume, mix, play pause)
- sounds
- input rotations, speeds, pallete rotations etc
- adjust graphics sizes on files? or setup size on data?
- optimize graphics (png 256 alpha contains extra photo at the corners???)
- implement x, y & rotate movement based on time
- implement sizex, sizey based on canvas size
