TODOs
- enemies entering scene from outside
- levels or linear difficulty increase
- empty canvas black palette animation
- encode inertia into player data
- encode trembling into player data
- implement player trembling
- collision feedback (visual, auditory)
- sounds
- scoring improvement. player on boundaries gains less score.
- high score (local storage)
- space like player rotation while moving
- background, heath + score, obstacles rotation should not use RAF timestamp because they advance when game tab is not active

IMPROVE
- favicon
- conditional rounding (rounding vs no rounding [subpixel rendering]) based on performance
- full refresh on redeployment
- hide fps, or provide a way to toggle, or show as a bottom left discreet small semi transparent green cool looking fsp meter
- resizing canvas needs to recalculate sizex, sizey, and radiusPixels of all elements

MAYBE/FUTURE
- use cloudflare
- webp

NO/IGNORE
- github link

DONE
- score UI
- health UI
- lock orientation on PWA? NO.
- splash screen
- calculate game screen (max X, Y -> resize/scale canvas on more than that, or simply center a bounded box).
- loader UI
- manifest.json metadata
- SEO metatags
- evaluate a sound engine (volume, mix, play pause)
- sounds
- input rotations, speeds, pallete rotations etc
- adjust graphics sizes on files? or setup size on data?
- optimize graphics (png 256 alpha contains extra photo at the corners???)
- implement x, y & rotate movement based on time
- implement sizex, sizey based on canvas size
